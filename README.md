This is a Work in Progress
Everything can change drastically from one day to another.


Installation
Remember to npm install
Inside "private" folder there are example files, rename them and fill it with your info

This project uses better-sqlite3 for some funcionalities. You better look at this ;)

And if it stills fails install with "LZZ_COMPAT=1 npm install better-sqlite3"
Trust me, it's worth the extra steps.

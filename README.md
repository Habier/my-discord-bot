This is a Work in Progress  
Everything can change drastically from one day to another.


## Installation
Remember to **npm install**  
Inside "private" folder there are example files, delete the .example extension and fill it with your info

This project uses **better-sqlite3** for some funcionalities. You better look at this ;)
